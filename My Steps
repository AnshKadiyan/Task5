1.Install Wireshark.
    -> Preinstalled in Kali


2.Start capturing on your active network interface.
    -> Capturing the "wlan0" interface


3.Browse a website or ping a server to generate traffic.
    -> browsed to "github.com"


4.Stop capture after a minute.
    -> stopped after a minute


5.Filter captured packets by protocol (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP).
    -> did as asked


6.Identify at least 3 different protocols in the capture.
    -> Protocols found are:
        i.   ARP:     used for resolving the IP addresses to the MAC addresses on the local network
        ii.  DNS:     used for resolution of domain names to the IP addresses
        iii. ICMPv6:  used by IPv6 networks for device discovery, address resolution, and basic network error handling
        iv.  TCP:     in my case, to establish the connection through 3-way hanshake and then delivering the acknowledgements
        v.   TLSv1.3: for secure and encrypted communication
        vi.  UDP:     for faster but less reliability of data delivery


7.Export the capture as a .pcap file.
    -> captured and exported as .pcap file
    -> uploaded the file here as Task5.pcap


8.Summarize your findings and packet 
    -> The captured network traffic mainly shows normal communication happening on the system. DNS packets are used to resolve domain names
        into IP addresses, after which TCP connections are established using the three-way handshake. Most of the web traffic is encrypted 
        and observed over TLSv1.3 on port 443, indicating secure HTTPS communication. ARP is used within the local network to map IP
        addresses to MAC addresses, while UDP traffic is primarily associated with DNS queries. Additionally, ICMPv6 packets are present 
        for IPv6 neighbor discovery and basic network control, which is expected behavior in an IPv6-enabled network.
